# Computer-Vision-Car-Detection

I recently completed a project on object detection using computer vision and deep learning. The goal of the project was to design and implement a system for detecting cars in real-time scenarios. To achieve this, I used a dataset of car images and trained multiple deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By using these models, I was able to accurately detect cars in real-time, achieving an accuracy of over 90%.

One of the key challenges of this project was to combine the predictions of multiple models in a way that was both accurate and efficient. To overcome this challenge, I used a technique called ensembling, which involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall accuracy of the system.
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in computer vision and deep learning, and to develop a better understanding of how to design and implement object detection systems. It also gave me the opportunity to work with large datasets and develop a better understanding of how to train and evaluate machine learning models.
